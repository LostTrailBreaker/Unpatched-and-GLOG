# Why Resource Dice?
Players can use resource dice to track uses of things, as opposed to individual uses. This helps eliminate the complete logistical pain that is tracking large quantities of quantities over time. While other options exist, I favor the dice chain. The upside with this is that players can tell when a resource is on the verge of running out.

# Dice Chain
- d8. Very abundant resource. Roll after scene. On a 1, drop down to d6.
- d6. Normal resource. Roll after scene. On a 1, drop down to d4.
- d4. Scarce resource. Roll after scene. On a 1, it runs out.

With a dice chain, avoid giving higher dice than d8, as this means that a resource will effectively never run out. A d8 should be reserved for something like an ancient wand, that can never be recharged. With a d6, a resource should be usable at least twice and have a decent (~50%) chance of giving 7 uses before running out.


#### Example Resources
1.  **Air** (1 stone) - d6 - roll per exploration action (so 3x per hour). For example, a breathing apparatus while diving.
2.  **Water** (1 stone) - d6 - roll per daily action (so 3x per day). This becomes important in a desert or a toxic swamp.
3.  **Food** (1 stone) - d6 - roll per day.
4.  **Light** - Torches (1 stone) - d6 - roll per exploration action (so 3x per hour). Dungeons.
5.  **Light** - Lamps (1 stone) - d6 - roll per hour.
6.  Ammunition - arrows (1 stone) - d6 - roll after every combat or hunt.Â 
7.  Ammunition - bullets or other ammunition that requires reloading - d6 - roll after every combat **turn.** This means you can end up having to reload (spend an action) during a combat. The plus is that a full ammo box (1 stone) might include enough ammo for several reloads.
8.  Charges - purchased wands - d6 - after every use. Wands are also awesome, because they're small and don't take up inventory space!
9.  Charges - irreplaceable ancient crap - d8 - after every use.

It goes without saying that **resources are fragile** and casual fireballs or lightning bolts may destroy them.
