# The Premise
Ever play _Dark Souls_? This takes a lot of inspiration from that. But it also takes inspiration from _Ultraviolet Grasslands_, _Fallout_, and other odd post-apocalyptic-ish things. I want something weird. I want something dangerous. I want something FUN. And I want to make it myself.

## Source Rules Modules and Hacks
- DEATHLESS runs using the [[MERIDIAN+DEATHLESS]] in its entirety.

- [[Rules for Carrying Things]]. This gets us most of the way there with meaningful encumbrance. Heavily inspired by BASTIONLAND’s BULKY inventory system. 
	- [Anti-Hammerspace](https://rottenpulp.blogspot.com/2012/06/matt-rundles-anti-hammerspace-item.html) is great, but I’m uncertain if I want that level of mini-game for inventory.
	- [[KIT]]. I’ll be updating this a bit to combine it with scavenging and some other things. It… doesn’t exactly jive so well with BULKY, so I may end up cutting this out.
	- [Triple X Depletion](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2018/09/triple-x-depletion-unified-depletion.html). Absolutely wonderful for handling the sort of resource management I want in this game.

- [[RUIN AND DECAY]]. This covers the system for harm and death. I quite like the way it works, though it could still use a bit of polishing. I think it’ll come along nicely.
	- OLD: [[FLESH AND RUIN]]. Again, more tweaking to be done in the future. DEATHLESS presents an interesting dilemma in that characters _cannot die_. Which means we have to set up other lasting penalties instead of death.

- Magic. How do we handle magic in the apocalypse without taking away the apocalypse?
	- [PSIONICS](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/06/psionics.html). I like the simplified magic system this presents. It might be worth porting, stealing, or adapting in some way.

## The Dying World; The Land Halfway
This is where I get to have most of my fun. The Land Halfway is an older, more obscure form of the setting for Meridian. I plan on throwing the players into it headfirst. It is a space on the edge of reality, where the world ends and the nothing begins. It is a place with more rhyme than reason. It is a hostile world, a beautiful world, a dying world.
