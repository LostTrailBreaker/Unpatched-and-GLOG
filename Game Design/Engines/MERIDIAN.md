# Meridian Engine
This ruleset was created for a strange, weird, completely off-the-walls world. It ignores and unapologetically breaks some precedents set by typical D&D-like games. The main goal of this is to create a framework that is:

* Simple and easy to understand.
* Adaptable, hackable, and compact.

## Referees and Rulings
The dice are not your masters. Only roll or call for a roll if both success and failure are interesting. If the narrative or common sense mean that a result is inevitable, don’t roll. Also, if failure is boring, just add some sort of caveat and make it success.

Failure has consequences. Think both in terms of immediate problems as well as opportunity costs. Time is a great example of opportunity cost: every moment spent here is one you can never spend again. Fail forward.

## The Core Mechanic
Every roll uses six-sided dice. A number of dice are rolled based on the circumstances, determining the consequences of the player’s action. The highest die rolled determines the result.

- Multiple 6s. You get what you want and more.
- 6. You get what you want.
- 4-5. You get what you want, along with a few consequences.
- 1-3. You get only the consequences.

## The Dice Pool
These are the dice you roll. Things happen now.

- **People.** +1d if it is possible for your species, or if your upbringing is helpful.
- **Skill.** +1d if you are skilled or do a clever thing.
- **Bid.** +1d to up the ante. What do you bid?
- **HD.** +1d that you may choose to add. If the HD rolls higher than any other die, you lose it.

## Skills
Skills are just a word or phrase that describes something a Hero is good at. The more specific the better. Season to taste.

## What Do You Bid?
As a rule, you can bid just about ANYTHING. Want to risk life and limb even more? Bid flesh. Want to sacrifice your mind for power? Bid ruin. This adds an additional consequence.

## HD: Hit Dice, Hero Dice, Hex Dice?
Heroes start with 3 HD - mettle, mana, what-have-you. A Hero can never have more than 6 HD. HD can be spent to:

* Roll the HD with your dice pool. The HD is only lost if it rolls higher than the other dice.
* Say “No!” to a consequence. It gets resisted, or the consequence simply doesn’t happen.
* Do anything suitably weird, like magic.

Spent HD are regained after resting. It’s up to the Referee exactly how this works. Maybe you just grab a snack and sit down, or maybe you need a week of peace.
