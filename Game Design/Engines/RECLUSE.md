# What is this?
It's a simple question-answering tool you can use to tell stories with unexpected twists, or as a drop in replacement for the oracle in your favorite GM emulator (I like so1um and the CRGE). Its two defining features are:
## Quick interpretation
No arithmetic, large table lookups, or state tracking to understand the results of a roll. Instead, we only do value comparisons between dice and high/low judgement. After a test roll or two, this can be done with a glance.
## Surprise
Lots of tools like this one inject randomness through plot twists, but the twist is usually introduced in the course of answering the question, or after it has been answered. With this tool, it's possible that the question itself is wrong, which fosters less predictable twists.

# Consulting the Oracle
You'll need 2d6 in one color, and 2d6 in another. I'll use black and white. To resolve a yes-or-no question, roll one balck die and one white die. If the white is highest, the answer is *Yes.* If the black is highest, the answer is *No*.

To find out if the answer is more nuanced than just a plain *Yes* or *No*, also look at the value on each die. If both are low (3 or less), add *But*. If both are high (4 or more), add *And*.

# Likely and Unlikely Events
*Yes* and *No* are equally likely if you use one die of each color. If circumstances are different, include an additional die in favor of the more likely outcome when you roll, but only keep the higher die of that color when you compare.

# What if I roll doubles?
If the dice are equal, some presupposition behind the question is wrong! This means that you're taking something for granted that makes it impossible to answer with "Yes" or "No." If it's obvious how your question could be assuming something, change it and ask something else. You can also use your favorite plot twist generator if you need to, but keep in mind that *the question itself was wrong;* you'll need to revise your assumption about the situation and the world, not just something new.
