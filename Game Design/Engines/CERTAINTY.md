Originally from [Bastionland](https://www.bastionland.com/)

I often find myself torn between:
-   A love of rolling dice to introduce an unexpected element into the game.
-   The decisiveness of just making a ruling without rolling dice.

So, of course, I exist in a sort of middle ground. I'm not especially drawn to entirely diceless games, but there's an allure to their philosophy of making judgement calls and focusing on adjudication and the grounding of the shared fiction.

Lately I've been especially interested in [Sam Doebler's posts](https://dreamingdragonslayer.com/tag/diceless/) on the subject, some of which was put into practice  with the not-actually-diceless [**_Skorne_**](https://dreamingdragonslayer.itch.io/skorne). Jim Parkin's [**_Any Planet is Earth_**](https://classless-kobolds.itch.io/any-planet-is-earth) exists in a similar not-diceless niche, acting as one of the big inspirations for Skorne. There's still rolling for success, but some situations (including most of combat) are given the diceless treatment. 

It got me thinking about the classic [Oracular Power of Dice](http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/04/on-oracular-power-of-dice.html) idea, and I feel you could have an interesting game that removes dice from the task-resolution process, but keeps them as a way to represent the uncertainty of the fictional world.

You lose that gambler feeling where you stand up for the pivotal roll like you're at a craps table and everybody cheers or groans at the result, but sometimes taking a powerful element like that out of an experience allows other moments to emerge that had been overshadowed by the Vegas-glitz. 

Here's a skeleton of what's been bouncing around in my head. I can already foresee some hurdles, but I'd like to try it out. 

**CERTAINTY SYSTEM**

In this game, dice are reserved for **Oracular** purposes, not for **Gambling**. The GM and players may roll them to unveil truths about the world, but they are never used to determine the success or failure of an action.

**Action**. The GM describes the current situation to the players and asks them to discuss a **Plan** of action.

The GM should especially consider:

**Action** - What specifically are they doing?   
**Outcome** - What does a successful outcome look like for this plan?   
**Leverage** - Why is this plan likely to succeed?

The GM decides which of the following **Forecasts** best fits the plan:   
**Blocked** - Something is stopping you.   
**Messy** - You'll do it but create another problem or suffer a cost.   
**Clean** - You'll do it, maybe even better than planned.

The GM then describes the Forecast in specifics and the players decide whether to act, modify their plan, or try something different.

Once the action takes place, and the impact occurs, the GM describes the world’s response and the new situation.

**Example of Play**

**GM**: As you're searching through the rubble you hear the clattering of a Giant Clawbug crawling toward you. It screeches, its tendril-crowned jaws coming at you.

**Player**: Right, I'm going to kill this thing with my sword.

**GM**: Okay, what's your **leverage**?

**Player**: I'm good with a sword, got some armour, this thing doesn't look so tough right?

**GM**: Well you'd need to get close and hack away at it and this thing is dripping with venom. Armour helps against the bites, but its tendrils would writhe through the gaps, so it's still **messy**. You'd kill it but definitely end up poisoned.

**Player**: Okay, I'll climb up onto that ledge instead and try throwing some rocks at it. It can't spit venom, right?

**GM**: What's the **outcome** you're hoping for?

**Player**: Just drive it away, I don't really need to kill it.

**GM**: Okay, that would be **clean**. You throw a few hefty rocks at the thing and it scurries away in the darkness. The cave is quiet again.
