# Design goals
1. Roll randomly to generate your character as much as possible
2. Do it as fast as possible and get gaming. 5 minutes is great. More than 10 minutes is wrong.
3. Over time, characters increase greatly in abilities (spells, connections, items) but not in power.

# Character Generation

## Bare Minimum
1. grab a paper and pencil
2. start with "proficiency bonus" of +2
3. roll 4d6 drop lowest in order for abilities. Speed is treated as an ability and starts at 12. Initiative starts equal to +1 by default (based on speed).
4. Pick a wizard, thief, or fighter character class.
5. Fill out character sheet with saving throws, armour, weapons, magic slots, skills & tools, and spells.
6. Get 100 coins and three inventory items.
