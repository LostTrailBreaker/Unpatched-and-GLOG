# ALARM - Referee-facing Procedure
### A word on timekeeping
Exploration time is measured in HOURS. As a rule of thumb, doing something interesting takes an HOUR. This includes exploring a room or otherwise moving through the dungeon. This assumes that the party is exploring "skyrim style," crouched and going slowly to find every trap and danger. Allow them to do so.

### Raise the ALARM
Exploring accumulates ALARM DICE. These are a measurement of how the dungeon (por other dangerous place) is waking up and reacting to the partyâ€™s presence.
ALARM DICE are gained by exploring a ROOM, engaging in violence, being loud, or doing other things that warrant raising the stakes.

### MEATGRINDER and encounters

Check for ENCOUNTERS every HOUR. Roll all of the accumulated ALARM DICE.
- The number of 1s rolled determines the encounter entry.
- The number of 6s rolled determines the treasure/cool-stuff entry.
