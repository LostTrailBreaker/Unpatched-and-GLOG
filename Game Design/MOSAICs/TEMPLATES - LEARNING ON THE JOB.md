Templates are gained diagetically through the completion of objectives or odd conditions. Each is equivalent to a title, GLOG template, or similar. Each template gives an interesting tool to the players.

Judge and create templates on a case-by-case basis. They are useful for narrative arcs and sandbox campaigns alike. They serve as a chronicle for the deeds of your heroes.
