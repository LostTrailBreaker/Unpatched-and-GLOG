# Flesh & Ruin: Rules for Getting Hurt
Fighting is a well-known part of adventuring. There are all sorts of cool things that happen in combat. This ruleset is not about those. I'll try to make the cool rules later. No, this ruleset is about all of the very UNCOOL things that happen to Heroes. Like getting hurt.

### Flesh Will Be Rent
Each time someone gets hurt and brushes it off, they gain a point of Flesh. If the attack was especially troublesome, they might gain multiple points of Flesh. The Flesh Score is a measure of all the little things, like tiny cuts and insignificant bruises that all add up to put a Hero in an early grave.

Flesh starts at 0, and counts upwards to 6. It resets after a long rest (however long that is) and some medical attention.

### Blood Will Be Spilled
Remember that Flesh Score? That's important here. When someone gets hurt, they roll a Flesh Check. That's a single d6 against their Flesh Score. If it rolls over, Flesh increases. If it rolls under, they get an Injury. Or a Wound. Whichever you like. There's no difference.

A Hero can, in general, take up to 3 Injuries. These are gashes, broken bones, anything severe enough that it'll take awhile to heal. Anything beyond that puts them at Death's Door.

Of course, mortal wounds might bring a Hero directly to Death's Door anyways.

### Dancing At Death's Door
A Hero at Death's Door needs immediate care to avoid dying. Even if they survive, their wounds may haunt them to the end of their days, leaving terrible scars and long-lasting injuries.
