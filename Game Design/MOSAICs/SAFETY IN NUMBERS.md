Title: "SAFETY IN NUMBERS"
Aliases:
---
It's dangerous to go alone: take others with you. Safety lies in numbers.

A wagon or similar vehicle can carry a fair amount, probably about what five or six people could carry slowly. For each wagon, write down a name and a brief description.

Each wagon needs a crew, too. A single waagon can be crewed by one or two people without much trouble. For each crew member, note their name and occupation, as well as a brief description. Determine these with as much randomness as you please.

Measure the size of a group in the number of mouths that it must feed.

Large groups are slower and more easily spotted, but also present a hardier target. Small groups move more quickly and are more easily hidden, but also present a much more vulnerable and tempting target to opportunists.
