# TRAVEL - Referee-facing Procedure

### A note on time
Travel time is measured in WEEKS. Things are far apart. If you want to go somewhere, youâ€™re in for the long haul. Every WEEK, these things happen:
- Each HERO consumes SUPPLIES
- HEROES make a FORTUNE roll.

### (MIS)FORTUNE ROLL
Each week, one HERO makes a FORTUNE roll:
- +1d for luck.
- +1d if the HERO is in good standing with spirits.
- +1d if the party has a competent navigator.
- +1d if the party is equipped for the climes.

#### Results
- **Multiple 6s.**Good Luck. Your understanding of the wilderness grows. Find some Supplies.
- **6.** Arduous travel. With good packing and a few travel games, the road is manageable.
- **4-5.** Inconveniences. Weevils in the supplies. Gear wears out. Storm blows away loose items. A pack animal wanders off.
- **1-3.** Disaster strikes. Horribly lost. Someone contracted a debilitating disease. Floods wash away the road. Things break down.
