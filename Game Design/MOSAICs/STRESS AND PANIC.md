# d6 STRESS and PANIC
Sanity and STRESS are fun mechanics. I like them. They promote growth of characters and provide another way for your HERO to be taken out of the action.

### And I Can’t STRESS This Enough
When a HERO sees beyond the pale, their mind breaks down. STRESS is a measure of how much of this unprocessed weirdness has built up.

Example causes of STRESS:
- Going more than 24 hours without food and drink
- Going 24 hours without rest
- Close brushes with danger
- When the [SMART GUY] fails their [SANITY SAVE]
- Witnessing or using MAGIC
- Other suitably anxiety-inducing situations

### PANIC
HEROES are resilient little creatures, but even they have their limits. When a HERO bears witness to something terribly traumatizing, their mind fractures; the mental breakdown can leave all sorts of lasting damage.

Situations that call for PANIC:
- Multiple other people PANICKING
- Encountering something strange or horrifying
- Being affected by MAGIC
- Being seriously injured
- Witnessing DEATH
- When all seems lost

More situations that might call for PANIC and STRESS
- Seeing death—_unless you’re already intimately familiar with it, which becomes its own problem…_
- Witnessing a particularly violent, traumatic, or gruesome scene. _Remember when Jenkins crammed the grenade into the faceplate of that guy’s power armor? Painted the whole damn room red._
- Realizing your own insignificance and helplessness. _The Total Perspective Vortex does a great job of teaching you your place in the world._
- Learning that which should not be learned. This leaves a permanent point of STRESS. _Eldritch rituals, taboo formulae, the name of a slumbering god._
- Any other suitably distressing event or action.
