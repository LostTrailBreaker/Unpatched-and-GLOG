A game is an exchange of questions and answers. I now present a hackneyed way to judge—broadly—how to handle some of these exchanges:

When someone asks if they know something, consider the following:
- Is it common knowledge? If so, they know it for free.
- Is it obscure knowledge? If so, they only know it if it is related to their skills, background, exploits, or if they are very lucky.

Answers should be as thorough as the questions. They do not replace clever thinking.
