# KIT: A Ruleset to Kill Inane Transactions
Allow me to preface this by saying that I have nothing against shopping; frequently, I find myself having a lot of fun shopping and browsing. I have everything against imaginary shopping because it bogs down my game and eats up time I (and likely my friends) would rather spend exploring the world.

## What is a KIT?
A character’s KIT is all the easily-replaceable gear they need to perform their profession. At least, that’s what it starts out as. A KIT is better described than specifically catalogued—function over forms, as it were.

> Graiveraiser. A set of implements, esoteric ingredients, and formulae to aid in the reanimation of deceased flesh. Practitioners of the art are generally reviled by the public.  

> Myrmidon. Tools for weapon and armor maintenance, a few spare knives, and a token for luck. The kit of a hardened mercenary.

It can be assumed that a character has any items suggested by their KIT. Items beyond the scope of their KIT must be specified in some other manner.
