# RUIN & DECAY
## RUIN Has Come
Each time a HERO gets hurt, they gain a point of RUIN. They may even gain multiple points of RUIN if the cause was particularly troublesome or dangerous. RUIN is a measure of how the world has worn on a HEROâ€™s body. It starts at 0 and counts upwards to 6. RUIN resets after a long rest (however long that is), as the soul-ego of the HERO repairs their body.

## Life DECAYs
When a HERO gains 6 points of RUIN, their soul-ego is irreparably damaged. This is reflected in their body as DECAY. Each bit of DECAY manifests as a unique trait, some sort of burden to carry or scar to bear.

Examples:
- A foolhardy knight is burned to death by the flame of a dracolich. Their skin becomes _blackened and charred_.
- An intrepid thief pushes their luck too far and triggers a trap, their flesh dissolved by acid. Now their body is _skeletal_.
- An unfortunate scholar delves too deep into the ancient works. Their mind broken, they _hear the voices of the Old Ones_.

## YOU DIED.
