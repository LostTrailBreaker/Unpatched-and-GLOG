# A MIGHT SCALE
Damage, armor, healing. All of these operate on some nonvariable scale. Let's quantify that a little more concretely, shall we?

The MIGHT SCALE has three tiers. You can call them whatever you want; I like "+1, +2, +3" and "Light, Heavy, Magic."

### Damage
Light damage is a couple of bruises or scrapes. Heavy damage is a broken limb, a concussion, or some other more immediately life-threatening injury. Magical damage always leaves a scar, if it can even be healed. Particular ingenuity or sacrifice doubles the damage of an attack.

### Armor
Armor absorbs as much damage as it can before breaking. Heavy armor is awkward and, well, heavy. Magic armor always comes with a cost or a catch.

### Healing
Light healing is a day of rest. Heavy healing is professional treatment. Magic healing always has a cost or drawback.
