Magic is corruption. This is known. Magic was always dangerous, even in the bright eras of the long ago.

Magic is uncertain. This too is known. A spell is a living thing that craves power, freedom, and something more. It is a spirit, a daemon, a thought, bound and made to serve. It craves fuel with which to burn ever brighter, and you are but another vessel. A spell's service, as always, is dearly purchasd and unpredictable.

Anyone can wield their innate power, but power without focus is inefficient, wild. A spell focuses power, helping to mold it.

When channeling magic, consider the following:
- **SOURCE.** Where is the power drawn from? What does this mean?
- **INTENT.** What do you want? What are you trying to do?
- **NATURE.** What is the inherent tendency of the spell? Its inclinations?

Channeling magic is dangerous. There is always a chance for something to go terribly wrong.

## Magic Dice (by Cal)

A mage starts with 1d6. As they progress, they can "level up" and over time gain more dice. Each time a spell is attempted, the dice is rolled. As with [Arnold K's system for GLOG wizards](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/09/the-glog-wizards.html), if you roll a 1-3 on the dice, you can reuse your spell again without taking a rest. If you roll a 4-6, the spell has been "used up" until you perform a long rest.

The storyteller also uses the [[CERTAINTY | ORACLE]] to determine the level of success of the spell.
