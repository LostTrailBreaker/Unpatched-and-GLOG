# INVENTORY
Inventory lists are dumb. Inventory management systems and mini-games have their place. That place is not here.

### Pictures, not Lists
Take a handful of index cards. On each one, draw a picture of a significant _THING_ you carry. Repeat until you have pictures for all of your stuff.

### Effects, Properties, What-Have-You
Write these on the back of the card. Brevity is a virtue. Interpretation is open.

### Encumbrance
Write BULKY on any large, heavy, or otherwise unwieldy THINGS. Carrying more than one BULKY THING means you are encumberedâ€”movement is slower, you get tired faster. TREASURE is always BULKY.
