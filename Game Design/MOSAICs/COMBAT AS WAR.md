# Combat & Confrontation
## Roll Every Time
Most things in combat require a roll. Aside from that, combat plays much the same as any other aspect of the game, with just a few adjustments.

## Take The Initiative
The side that has the drop on the other(s) goes first. Mess with this as you see fit, or eschew it entirely. Do what makes sense and is fun.

## Talking is (Not) a Free Action
Limit Players (and their respective Heroes) to a sentence or two at a time in combat. Fights are hectic and messy. There’s no time for intense tactical discussions during a brawl. You only have a moment to yell out something before getting punched in the face.

## Mooks And Monsters
Mooks are lesser minions, faceless enemies, and things that just aren’t good in a fight. Fights against Mooks are resolved in a single roll per Mook. Feel free to let Heroes take out several Mooks at once with good tactics.

Monsters are powerful foes, inhuman beasts, hulking knights, inscrutable machines. Fights against Monsters are bloody and long. You cannot defeat a Monster in any way that matters unless you are well and truly Prepared. You must:
- Be capable of physically harming it.
- Memorize its patterns and tactics.
- Have superior force of arms, or use the environment to your advantage.

## Wounds
Use common sense to judge what kind of wounds will be caused. In general, you can break up wounds into three categories:
- Light Wounds. Scratches, bruises, and other stuff that can be bandaged up and walked off.
- Severe Wounds. Gashes, flesh wounds. Takes at least a week to heal, might affect function.
- Mortal Wounds. Straight to Death’s Door. Might take weeks of bedrest to heal.

Don’t think too hard about this. Wounds and their effects are intentionally left nebulous and floating to encourage on-the-spot ruling, which always seems to make more sense than numbers.

Heroes can, in general, take up to 3 severe wounds. Anything beyond this is too much to bear, and places them at Death’s Door.

## Death’s Door
A Hero at Death’s Door needs immediate care to avoid dying. Their wounds may haunt them to the end of their days even if they survive, leaving terrible scars and long-lasting injuries.

## Healing
One Week of care clears one Severe Wound and any number of Light Wounds. This assumes access to decent medical care - bandages and some form of antiseptic at the very least.

Magic can speed up this process. Magic can also terribly mutate limbs and rearrange organs in ways mortals were not meant to witness.
