# Deprived - Exhaustion in HAVEN
Anyone who is DEPRIVED of a crucial need (food, water, warmth, etc.) cannot benefit from REST. Anything that would normally recover through rest does not do so, though most people still need rest to live.

Once someone's basic needs are met, they are no longer DEPRIVED.
