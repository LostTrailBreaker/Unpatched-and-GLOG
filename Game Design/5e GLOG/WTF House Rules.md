# Wizard-Thief-Fighter Rules

## Character Goals
1. Roll randomly to generate your character as much as possible
2. Do it as fast as possible and get gaming. 5 minutes is great. More than 10 minutes is wrong.
3. Over time, characters increase greatly in abilities (spells, connections, items) but not in power.

## 1a Character Generation
Minimum process:

1.  Grab a paper and pencil.
2.  Start with "proficiency bonus" of +2.
3.  Roll 4d6 drop lowest in order for abilities. Speed is treated as an ability and starts at 12. Initiative starts equal to +1 by default (based on Speed).
4.  Pick a wizard, thief or fighter character class.
5.  Fill out character sheet with saving throws, armour, weapons, magic slots, skills & tools, and spells.
6.  Get 100 coins and three inventory items.

Optional:

-   If the setting has different species, apply those modifiers.
-   Swap a couple of abilities, if you really want to.
-   Add 3 to 4 special starting abilities depending on your chosen class and type (e.g. soul magicians have different abilities). Or make them up.
-   If a player wants to use a standard 5E character, have them generate it whichever way suits you at 3rd level. After that, they gain experience as other characters in WTF.

## 1b Advancement
1.  At the end of every game session, the player rolls on the class experience table (e.g. [this](http://wizardthieffighter.blogspot.ch/2016/01/the-wizard-arrives.html)) and their character acquires a new trait or ability. Each result should be used only once, so re-roll duplicates.
2.  Optionally, make a custom list.
3.  Optionally, complex quests or dungeons should have bonus boons and experience results as part of their "treasure".
4.  Optionally, carousing and [class-specific achievements](http://wizardthieffighter.blogspot.ch/2016/09/classy-xp-for-wizards-thieves-and.html) can be linked, too.

## 1c Other stuff is optional
The key rule is, "if something sounds cool, sure, add it and try it out."

1.  The Trinkets table on p. 160 of the 5E PHB is great. Recommended.
2.  Personality and backgrounds. If a player wants to add this stuff to their character, it's fine.
3.  Feats - if players really want them, let them add them on a roll of 20 for experience at the end of the session. Or as per the class tables.
4.  Inspiration is optional.
5.  Alignment is _really_ optional.

## Magic
-   Any class can cast spells if they have learned them (possible as adventure rewards or from scrolls), but unless they have spell slots (acquired as class level-ups), they have to use hit points or ability points to cast them. 
-   Any character can use any armour, but if they do not have a proficiency in it, they have a **disadvantage** on physical attacks, skill checks and must make saving throws to cast spells.
-   Any character can use any weapon, but if they do not have proficiency in it, they do not add their proficiency bonus to it.

## Resources
The core problem of time is that it consumes resources. Tracking time and reducing resources is important to keep players challenged and give them meaningful choice, but ... detailed tracking time and resources is a complete pain, so in WTF players use resource dice. There are two options:

-   **Simple:** Roll a die (usually a d12) after every scene where a resource was used, on a 1 it has run out.
-   **Dice Chain:**
	-   d8 - Very abundant resource. Roll after scene >  on 1, drop down to d6.
	-   d6 - Normal resource. Roll after scene >  on 1, drop down to d4.
	-   d4 - Scarce resource. Roll after scene > on 1, it runs out.

With a dice chain, avoid giving higher dice than d8, as this means that a resource will effectively never run out. A d8 should be reserved for something like an ancient wand, that can never be recharged. With a d6, a resource should be usable at least twice and have a decent (~50%) chance of giving 7 uses before running out. The great benefit of a dice chain for resources is that a player can tell when a certain resource is on the verge of giving out.

#### Example resources:

1.  **Air** (1 stone) - d6 - roll per exploration action (so 3x per hour). For example, a breathing apparatus while diving.
2.  **Water** (1 stone) - d6 - roll per daily action (so 3x per day). This becomes important in a desert or a toxic swamp.
3.  **Food** (1 stone) - d6 - roll per day.
4.  **Light** - Torches (1 stone) - d6 - roll per exploration action (so 3x per hour). Dungeons.
5.  **Light** - Lamps (1 stone) - d6 - roll per hour.
6.  Ammunition - arrows (1 stone) - d6 - roll after every combat or hunt. 
7.  Ammunition - bullets or other ammunition that requires reloading - d6 - roll after every combat **turn.** This means you can end up having to reload (spend an action) during a combat. The plus is that a full ammo box (1 stone) might include enough ammo for several reloads.
8.  Charges - purchased wands - d6 - after every use. Wands are also awesome, because they're small and don't take up inventory space!
9.  Charges - irreplaceable ancient crap - d8 - after every use.

It goes without saying that **resources are fragile** and casual fireballs or lightning bolts may destroy them.
