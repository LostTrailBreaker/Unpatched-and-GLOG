***Where is my eye?***

The eye of Heimdall is a legendary item that grants the user the ability to see through illusions and over vast distances, even when normal sight is obstructed.

Carved out by the Jotunns during the first Ragnarok, this eye has gone centuries without a body, and is desperate for a host. It is parasitic, and cannot easily be removed once inserted. It drains energy over time, using up spell slots or causing exhaustion and lowered strength and dexterity over time. 

**Power comes with sacrifice.** In order to use this object, you must sacrifice one of your eyes (if you don’t already have an empty eye socket). Once inserted, Heimdall’s eye heals the wound, but causes exhaustion, making you [[DEPRIVED]] until you take a long rest. 

Using this item takes 1 spell slot. Using it causes 1 point of [[STRESS AND PANIC|STRESS]] until you take a short rest. Both spellcasters and non-spellcasters will have exhaustion and be [[DEPRIVED]] afterwards until you take a short rest.

Heimdall’s eye will also decrease your passive perception while you use it, as you are distracted.

***What do you say? Will you choose to use my eye? Or do you prefer ignorance over pain? Choose wisely, my friend.***
