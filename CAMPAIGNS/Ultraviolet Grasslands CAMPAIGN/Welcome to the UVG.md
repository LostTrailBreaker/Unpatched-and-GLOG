# Actual Play Report
This game was based on a modified version of Luka Rejec's [Ultraviolet Grasslands and the Black City].

The group began their journey at the Last Good House on the edge of the Violet City, contemplating the track into the grasslands. Abner tried repeatedly to eat his party members, though to no avail. After getting a stiff drink and pondering their options, Tess led the crew to the College of Memory, where they had studied magic.

At the College of Memory, the group met Professor Seranni, who hired them to capture Vomes for her to study. They also solicited the aid of the fleshcrafter Olin, who enthusiastically lent them a prototype Centipede transport for their travel. Now kitted out with supplies and gear, the group headed into the grasslands.

Arriving at the Low Road and the High Road, the party asked around until they found the blue-skinned observer Lel, who directed them towards what appeared to be a vome nest. After some scouting, the party raided the area around the nest at the Potshead Crown and took down six vomes, successfully capturing 4. Tess used a spell to crystallize the soul-ego of one vome, but did not tell this to their companions. In return for the opportunity to observe and sketch a few vome specimens, Lel gifted the party a wand he had found.

That night, Abner's patron, Kaedrick the Broken, identified the wand as containing a spell of animation, and praised the blob for recovering it. Tess's patron also praised them for successfully distilling a soul before issuing a quest: to find an innovation or idea, something new and unique, to feed Palabra Jot's hunger. Tess immediately saw the options, and started laughing nervously.

Upon their return, the crew received additional funds in exchange for the captured vomes and sent in the Centipede for tune-ups.

“Unpatched” Session 1 Summary

Characters:
-ABNER
-CALEB
-COLE
-KARENATOR


The party arrives in the violet city, each with 100 coins to their name. They wish to cross the Ultraviolet Grasslands, but do not have enough money for supplies. They ask around for jobs, then realize that a scholar would most likely be willing to sponsor them.

The party goes to a wizard college in search of a sponsorship. The college happens to be the same one Cole went to, a college focused on memory. They find a scholar there willing to pay for their trip in exchange for living voams, which they would pay 1000 coins per specimen.

The party visits the flesh sculptors and makes a deal to test out a new contraption, using it for free. This contraption is the centipede, and acts as a transportation and storage device.

The party ventured out to the plains in search of a voam hive, and someone studying the creatures points them in the right direction. They say that they’ll give the party a magical engraved metal rod in exchange for a sketch of the voams.

The party captures 4 voams, and Cole takes the soul of another, hiding this from the party. They show the live voams to the scholar, and Abner takes the magic rod. They rest in a shopping mall for the night, and both Abner and Cole are visited by their patrons in their dreams.

Abner’s patron is proud of him. He examines the rod and determines that it is a wand with a necromantic spell. The wand is old, and his patron doesn’t know who made it, which troubles him. He tells Abner that sometime he will teach him to make his own wand.

Cole’s patron is glad to see that they used their spell. Seeing the craving for power in their eyes, she promises to teach them more in exchange for an idea.

After sleeping, the party contacts the engineer and the scholar, and head back to the city. They turn in the voams to the scholar, and Cole gives the soul to the scholar in secret, gaining a favor. They return the centipede to the engineer for maintenance.
