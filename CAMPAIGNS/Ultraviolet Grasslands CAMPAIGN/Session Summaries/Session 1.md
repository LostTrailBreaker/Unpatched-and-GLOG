## “Unpatched” Session 1 Summary

Characters:
-[[ABNER]]
-[[CALEB]]
-[[COLE]]
-[[KARENATOR]]


The party arrives in the violet city, each with 100 coins to their name. They wish to cross the Ultraviolet Grasslands, but do not have enough money for supplies. They ask around for jobs, then realize that a scholar would most likely be willing to sponsor them.

The party goes to a wizard college in search of a sponsorship. The college happens to be the same one Cole went to, a college focused on memory. They find a scholar there willing to pay for their trip in exchange for living voams, which they would pay 1000 coins per specimen.

The party visits the flesh sculptors and makes a deal to test out a new contraption, using it for free. This contraption is the centipede, and acts as a transportation and storage device.

The party ventured out to the plains in search of a voam hive, and someone studying the creatures points them in the right direction. They say that they’ll give the party a magical engraved metal rod in exchange for a sketch of the voams.

The party captures 4 voams, and Cole takes the soul of another, hiding this from the party. They show the live voams to the scholar, and Abner takes the magic rod. They rest in a shopping mall for the night, and both Abner and Cole are visited by their patrons in their dreams.

Abner’s patron is proud of him. He examines the rod and determines that it is a wand with a necromantic spell. The wand is old, and his patron doesn’t know who made it, which troubles him. He tells Abner that sometime he will teach him to make his own wand.

Cole’s patron is glad to see that they used their spell. Seeing the craving for power in their eyes, she promises to teach them more in exchange for an idea. She rewards them with a new spell that allows them to delve into the minds of others. 

After sleeping, the party contacts the engineer and the scholar, and head back to the city. They turn in the voams to the scholar, and Cole gives the soul to the scholar in secret, gaining a favor. They return the centipede to the engineer for maintenance.
