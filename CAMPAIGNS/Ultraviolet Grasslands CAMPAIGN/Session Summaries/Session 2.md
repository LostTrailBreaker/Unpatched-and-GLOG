## "Unpatched" Session 2 Notes

Characters:
-ABNER
-CALEB
-COLE
-[[WING]]

The party restocks on rations, gets the centipede serviced, and buys an autowagon. They then depart for the voam hive once again, stopping to talk to some nomads who seem to be fleeing. Something seems to have changed belowground, causing the residents to become anxious. 

The party enters the voam hive, which is unusually hot and humid for a cave. They come across a fork in the tunnel, one with a flickering light at the end, the other eerily dark and quiet. The party sticks together and heads towards the light. They find a forge with a strange biomechanical creature in the center, attached to cables hanging from the ceiling. Caleb stayed back and kept his rifle trained on the creature, while the rest of the party moved in. Cole and Wing try to speak to the creature. It speaks of "the mother", a creature it works for, creating voams. It claims "the mother" is the creator of all things. Despite chiding by Abner's patron to not do so, Abner bites the creature. It becomes aggravated and attacks, as a lone voam stumbles into the room.

The party kills the lone voam and leaves the forge creature. They head back to the fork in the tunnel, and turn down the dark tunnel. There they find many shards of metal and pieces of bone. At the end of the tunnel they find a large wormlike creature, which passes them by and begins digging another tunnel nearby. Wandering further, they find a dead hive queen, and take the body back to the violet city with them.

On their way back to the Violet City, the party finds a sculpture of a hand coming out of the ground. Nearby are many rich people having a picnic. Cole attempts to cast their new spell on an old man who is painting nearby. The spell backfires, and they end up becoming unable to speak in an understandable way. Wing decides to use their spell (bloodlust) on the painter, who becomes overwhelmed by rage and attacks them with a knife. Wing pushes a person, which they soon realized was a voam, into the painter and they begin fighting. The painter "stabs" the creature, though it doesn't leave any visible marks. Both the painter and the voam act as though the voam was really stabbed. Cole reattempts their spell and succeeds, burrowing into the mind of the painter and unraveling the anger found within, ending the spell. The party flees.

Caleb seeks to sell his soul. He first goes to the temple of radiation, but quickly runs away after seeing one of the believers covered in tumors. He then goes to a radio station, and gets a patron through the radio (some sort of radio god). All party members present are now Warlocks. Caleb then finds Cole at the mind college and drags them off to the flesh sculptors to try and fix their vocal chords to allow them to be able to speak normally again.
