# UNPATCHED CORE
1.  is designed around [Free Kriegspiel](https://www.revenant-quill.com/p/free-kriegsspiel-roleplaying.html) principles, and is supplemented by the ideas of [MOSAIC Strict](http://blog.trilemma.com/2021/02/nothing-at-bottom-mosaic-strict-rpg.html) design, though it does not adhere to them.

2. UNPATCHED is an incomplete game; the CORE is only meant to be a start. Write more rules as you need them, or find things that are cool and add them.

3. UNPATCHED relies on six-sided dice (abbreviated for X six-sided dice as Xd or Xd6) for most of its random number generation.

## CERTAINTY: Conflict Resolution (Adapted from BASTIONLAND)
In this game, dice are reserved for **Oracular** purposes, not for **Gambling**. The GM and players may roll them to unveil truths about the world, but they are never used to determine the success or failure of an action.

**Action**. The GM describes the current situation to the players and asks them to discuss a **Plan** of action.

The GM should especially consider:

**Action** - What specifically are they doing?   
**Outcome** - What does a successful outcome look like for this plan?   
**Leverage** - Why is this plan likely to succeed?

The GM decides which of the following **Forecasts** best fits the plan:   
**Blocked** - Something is stopping you.   
**Messy** - You'll do it but create another problem or suffer a cost.   
**Clean** - You'll do it, maybe even better than planned.

The GM then describes the Forecast in specifics and the players decide whether to act, modify their plan, or try something different.

Once the action takes place, and the impact occurs, the GM describes the world’s response and the new situation.

## GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE: Oracle (Adapted from [Graven Utterance](https://gravenutterance.com/2019/03/24/recluse-solo-engine/))
You'll need 2d6 in one color, and 2d6 in another. I'll use black and white. To resolve a yes-or-no question, roll one balck die and one white die. If the white is highest, the answer is *Yes.* If the black is highest, the answer is *No*.

To find out if the answer is more nuanced than just a plain *Yes* or *No*, also look at the value on each die. If both are low (3 or less), add *But*. If both are high (4 or more), add *And*.

### Likely and Unlikely Events
*Yes* and *No* are equally liiekly if you use one die of each color. If circumstances are different, include an additional die in favor of the more likely outcome when you roll, but only keep the higher die of that color when you compare.

### What if I roll doubles?
If the dice are equal, some presupposition behind the question is wrong! This means that you're taking soemthing for granted that makes it impossible to answer with "Yes" or "No." If it's obvious how your question could be assuming something, change it and ask something else. You can also use your favorite plot twist generator if you need to, but keep in mind that *the uestion itself was wrong;* you'll need to revise your assumption about the situation and the world, not just something new.

## LORE: To Know a Thing... (Adapted from Rise Up Comus)
Character knowledge follows similar rules to what characters can see. There are essentially two levels of knowledge.
- **Obvious knowledge (level 1):** Stuff everybody knows and sets the general expectations of the encounter. Giving players a lot of information makes sure that both players and the GM are on the same page and lets players make intelligent choices.
- **Obscure knowledge (level 2):** Some specialist subjects would only be known to certain people. Obscure knowledge might include the habits of mythical creatures, the likes and dislikes of specific people within an organization, or the metaphysics of the planes of reality. In these cases, the GM should only give information to a player who has **bid lore** (see below). If a player bids lore and the GM accepts the question, the GM should give as much information on the subject as they know—keep talking and riffing until you run out of material.

### Bidding LORE
A HERO knows the LORE of their GROUP, as well as any others they have picked up through careful study and travel. A HERO can BID LORE by asking a specific, discrete question that pertains to the LORE they know. 

HEROES can BID LORE as often as they like, so long as it does not annoy the GM. Upon getting frustrated with frivolous LORE BIDS, the GM can revoke LORE privileges as they see fit.

## SIMPLISTIC AVATARS: Creating a HERO
UNPATCHED is a [[CLASSLESS]] framework, meaning that it does not adhere to D&D- or Chainmail-like progression and systems. Character creation is as much a part of the core game as anything else; it should be fast and lightweight while still leaving room for creativity and personalization. That being said, don't get too attached to your characters until you've played a game or two with them.

A HERO consists of four parts:
1. a NAME by which to identify them.
2. a TRAIT that describes them, condensed into a single word.
3. a GROUP to which they belong: what they do/did for a living, who they lived with, how they were educated, or anything else that might be relevant.
4. a DEBT owed to someone (or something), somewhere.

Further refinements may be made during play as HEROES change.

A HERO also begins with three significant items and a KIT that pertains to their GROUP. This means they can be reasonably expected to have whatever they would need to go about a normal day as defined by their GROUP.

## THE DEATH OF HAMMERSPACE: Visual Inventory
Inventory lists are dumb. Inventory management systems and mini-games have their place. That place is not here. Focus more on plausibility and understanding where things are stored.

### Pictures, not Lists
Take a handful of index cards. On each one, draw a picture of a significant THING you carry. Repeat until you have pictures for all of your stuff. If you have a KIT, draw assorted items from that and write its GROUP on the card too. If the THING is unique or is of particular note, write the significant parts of it on the back of the card. Brevity is a virtue. Interpretation is open.

### Encumbrance
Write BULKY on any large, heavy, or otherwise unwieldy THINGS. Carrying more than one BULKY THING means you are encumbered—movement is slower, you get tired faster. TREASURE is always BULKY.

### Depletion
When a resource is used or an item is damaged, mark an X next to it. After 3 Xs, it is used up or broken. If you use something for an outside-of-the-box use, such as leaving your food out as bait, immediately mark depletion. Magic items last twice as long, so one depletion gives / and a second becomes X. Magic weapons and armor can only be repaired by mad smiths. The price is never in money.

## ZERO-SUM: Experience and Advancement, or lack therof
After each session, write down one significant event that impacted your HERO. If you feel this event was significant enough, you may change one of the following:
- NAME. Identities change. So too can names to reflect them.
- TRAIT. Exchange for a different word that now describes the HERO.
- GROUP. Perhaps their membership has expired, relationships strained, or they now pursue a different course of study.

DEBT may not be changed arbitrarily; it must be paid in full or the consequences will be felt.

Occasionally, HEROES may also earn TITLES for their DEEDS. Each TITLE represents some significant accomplishment on the part of the HERO, and grants some appropriate tool as the culmination of the lessons learned in pursuit of that goal. Some examples are listed below:
- CARTOGRAPHER. By meticulously mapping out several weeks of travel, you have drastically improved your navigational skills and survey knowledge alike. You can reliably answer the questions "what's over there" and "where might this be located" so long as you have spent some time surveying and adding to your map while traveling in the general area.
- GRAVERAISER. After training for a year and a day under the direction of a master of the Necropolis, you have learned to manipulate a single FORM of the human body: BONE, FLESH, or ROT. Many consider you to be revolting.
- LAMARCKIAN. By integrating votive nanomachines and long-forbidden magics into every particle of your body, you have gained a measure of shapeshifting ability, able to change any one body part at a time while retaining cohesion. However, the unstable nanites that comprise your form convey upon you the same vulnerabilities as any machine, and those who know your true nature either fear you or revere you.
- WARLOCK. You have sworn yourself to a PATRON, gaining a second DEBT in exchange for quickly unlocking your innate power and gaining a SPELL. The whims of your PATRON are not necessarily known to you.
